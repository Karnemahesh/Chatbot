Let's break down the training process used for Gemini 1.5 Pro, based on the information provided in the document.\n\n**Key Aspects of the Training Process:**\n\n1.  **Model Architecture:**\n    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.\n    *   It builds upon the research advances of Gemini 1.0 and a longer history of MoE research at Google.\n    *   MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows for a larger total parameter count while keeping the number of activated parameters constant.\n\n2.  **Training Infrastructure:**\n    *   Trained on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators.\n    *   The training is distributed across multiple datacenters.\n\n3.  **Training Data:**\n    *   A variety of multimodal and multilingual data is used.\n    *   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from various domains, including web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.\n\n4.  **Instruction Tuning:**\n    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n    *   Further tuning is based on human preference data.\n\n5.  **Long-Context Understanding:**\n    *   The model incorporates significant architecture changes to enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n\n6.  **Safety Mitigations:**\n    *   Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) are used to mitigate safety risks.\n    *   The safety mitigation is focused on adversarial or \"harm-inducing\" queries.\n    *   New image-to-text SFT data is incorporated, as safety SFT data for text-only queries was not as effective for harm-inducing image-to-text queries.\n\n**In summary:** The training process for Gemini 1.5 Pro involves a combination of a sophisticated MoE Transformer architecture, massive computational resources, diverse multimodal data, instruction tuning, and safety mitigations.

Here's an ELI5 explanation of the training process for a large language model like Gemini 1.5:\n\n**Imagine you're teaching a puppy to understand and respond to commands.**\n\n1.  **Gathering the Data (The Puppy's Learning Material):**\n    *   First, you need lots and lots of examples of text, images, audio, and video. Think of it as a huge library filled with books, pictures, songs, and movies.\n    *   This data is used to teach the model about the world and how language works.\n\n2.  **Building the Model (The Puppy's Brain):**\n    *   The model is like a big, complicated computer program. It has lots of connections and settings that can be adjusted.\n    *   At the beginning, the model doesn't know anything. It's like a puppy with a brand new brain.\n\n3.  **Training the Model (Teaching the Puppy):**\n    *   You feed the model the data you gathered earlier.\n    *   The model tries to predict what comes next in the data. For example, if you give it the sentence \"The cat sat on the...\", it might try to guess the next word.\n    *   If the model guesses correctly, you give it a little reward (like a treat for the puppy). If it guesses wrong, you give it a little correction.\n    *   The model adjusts its connections and settings based on the rewards and corrections. This is how it learns.\n    *   This process is repeated millions or billions of times. The model gets better and better at predicting what comes next.\n\n4.  **Fine-Tuning (Polishing the Puppy's Skills):**\n    *   Once the model has learned the basics, you can fine-tune it for specific tasks.\n    *   For example, you might train it to answer questions, write stories, or translate languages.\n    *   This is like teaching the puppy specific tricks, like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" or \"fetch.\"\n\n5.  **Evaluating and Improving (Checking the Puppy's Progress):**\n    *   You test the model to see how well it performs on different tasks.\n    *   If it makes mistakes, you analyze the mistakes and adjust the training process to improve the model.\n    *   This is like taking the puppy to obedience school and working with a trainer to fix any problems.\n\n**Key Ideas:**\n\n*   **Lots of Data:** The more data the model sees, the better it learns.\n*   **Prediction:** The model learns by trying to predict what comes next.\n*   **Adjustments:** The model adjusts its connections and settings based on feedback.\n*   **Iteration:** The training process is repeated many times to improve the model.\n\nIn essence, training a large language model is like teaching a very smart puppy to understand and respond to the world around it. The puppy learns by seeing lots of examples, making guesses, and getting feedback. Over time, it becomes very good at understanding and responding to language.\n\n-----"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":" স্কোর: 1\n\nExplanations:While the response is formatted well and easy to understand, the prompt specifically requested a summarization of the text provided in the file, which the model failed to do.

Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by two AI models. We will provide you with the user input and a pair of AI-generated responses (Response A and Response B). You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.\n\nYou will first judge responses individually, following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Then you will give step-by-step explanations for your judgment, compare results to declare the winner based on the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.\n\n# Evaluation\n## Metric Definition\nYou will be assessing question answering quality, which measures the overall quality of the answer to the question in the user prompt. Pay special attention to length constraints, such as in X words or in Y sentences. The instruction for performing a question-answering task is provided in the user prompt. The response should not contain information that is not present in the context (if it is provided).\n\n## Criteria\nInstruction following: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the question answering task instructions, satisfying all of the instruction's requirements.\nGroundedness: The response contains information included only in the context if the context is present in the user prompt. The response does not reference any outside information.\nCompleteness: The response completely answers the question with sufficient detail.\nFluent: The response is well-organized and easy to read.\n\n## Rating Rubric\n\"A\": Response A answers the given question as per the criteria better than response B.\n\"SAME\": Response A and B answers the given question equally well as per the criteria.\n\"B\": Response B answers the given question as per the criteria better than response A.\n\n## Evaluation Steps\nSTEP 1: Analyze Response A based on the question answering quality criteria: Determine how well Response A fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent, and provides assessment according to the criterion.\nSTEP 2: Analyze Response B based on the question answering quality criteria: Determine how well Response B fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent, and provides assessment according to the criterion.\nSTEP 3: Compare the overall performance of Response A and Response B based on your analyses and assessment.\nSTEP 4: Output your preference of \"A\", \"SAME\" or \"B\" to the pairwise_choice field according to the Rating Rubric.\nSTEP 5: Output your assessment reasoning in the explanation field.\n\n# User Inputs and AI-generated Responses\n## User Inputs\n### Prompt\n{prompt}\n\n# AI-generated Response\n\n### Response A\n{baseline_model_response}\n\n### Response B\n{response}\n\"\"\"\n\n\nclass AnswerComparison(enum.Enum):\n  A = 'A'\n  SAME = 'SAME'\n  B = 'B'\n\n\n@functools.cache\ndef eval_pairwise(prompt, response_a, response_b, n=1):\n  \"\"\"Determine the better of two answers to the same prompt.\"\"\"\n\n  chat = client.chats.create(model='gemini-2.0-flash')\n\n  # Generate the full text response.\n  response = chat.send_message(\n      message=QA_PAIRWISE_PROMPT.format(\n          prompt=[prompt, document_file],\n          baseline_model_response=response_a,\n          response=response_b)\n  )\n  verbose_eval = response.text\n\n  # Coerce into the desired structure.\n  structured_output_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n      response_mime_type=\"application/json\",\n      response_schema=AnswerComparison,\n  )\n  response = chat.send_message(\n      message=\"Convert the final score.\",\n      config=structured_output_config,\n  )\n  structured_eval = response.parsed\n\n  return verbose_eval, structured_eval\n\n\nquestion = questions[0]\nanswer_a = answer_question(question, terse_guidance)\nanswer_b = answer_question(question, cited_guidance)\n\ntext_eval, struct_eval = eval_pairwise(\n    prompt=question,\n    response_a=answer_a,\n    response_b=answer_b,\n)\n\ndisplay(Markdown(text_eval))\nprint(struct_eval)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-31T08:40:15.768920Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-31T08:40:15.769438Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-31T08:40:17.454740Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-31T08:40:15.769395Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-31T08:40:17.453527Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"STEP 1: Analyze Response A based on the question answering quality criteria:\nResponse A provides a very basic answer to the query.
